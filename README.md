# clearcartlogin
---------------------------------------------
This PRESTASHOP module will let you empty the cart of an specific group of customers.

Let's say you have an specific agreement with one group of customers and they have some product disabled. If before they login they add it to the cart it will be available for sale; for this reason, their cart should be emptied before they login.

You just have to activate the "Live mode" and fill in the group id numbers separated with a comma, i.e., 4,5,6,7,8,9,10
